	<string name="help_content_text">"Welcome to Diet Manager!
		This application is intended to help you in keeping a diet.\n
		Diet Manager will remind you your meals time, watch your daily calories consumption and track your meals and weight. How to get started? It’s easy, up to now you had configured the relevant info about you in order to keep your diet which includes your sex, age, height, weight and desired weight, also your daily physical activity and the usual times you wake up and go to sleep. If you think there is an error in any of the configurations go to the “User Info” tab (on top) and click “Edit info” or “Edit times” buttons (bottom of the screen).\n
		When you first started the application you've noticed that it generates menus for your meals. The generated menus are scheduled for some defaults meals (also the recommended ones) How you can see all the menus? Simply go to the “General” tab an click on “Menus List” (also you can see all the foods in the database clicking on “Foods List”) the schedule of your meals is reachable through the application menu (push the menu button of your device to see it) on the “Planning” item.\n
		It’s time to explain how Diet Manager works: well, with the info about you and the generated menus, Diet Manager will remind you about your recommended meals time (from the breakfast to the nightly snack, every 3 hours), also it will offer you a menu (you can add, remove or change any food, even find a replacement with an equivalent amount of calories). Every time you perform a meal you should enter the data about the foods of your meals (button “I’ll eat now” of the “Diet” tab) in Diet Manager in order to keep your diet tracking (notice you don’t need a menu for enter the info you could pick the foods directly from the database). Diet Manager will show the info about your calories consumption in the “Diet” tab and will warn you when your consumption surpass the limit for the recommended one (keep in mind that the generated menus are specially designed to keep your calories consumption in the recommended range). You can see the tracking of your diet in the “General” tab in the two
		charts of the main view.\n
		So, how Diet Manager decides the calories consumption you need? Well, it is calculated with your Body Mass Index and Basal Metabolic Rate (google both of this!), with this two parameters the application can determine the amount of calories you have been consuming (daily) and the amount you need to consume in order to reach your desired weight. Diet Manager will reduce in the first 15 days of your diet (every 5 days) your calories consumption until you reach the recommended value. Diet Manager will check your weight every 10 days and will warn you for update it (feel free of update it every day if you like!).\n As an important issue, Diet Manager lets you add/edit new foods to the database and create/edit menus which you can use in the Planning of your diet, but be careful! The info in the database is used to track your diet and every change in the calories of a food could invalidate the correctness of the values in your past meals so the diet you have been taking would not be right
		tracked! But always is safe to add a new food or menu :)\n
		Don’t panic if you want to eat Fast Food, explore this category in the Foods database."
